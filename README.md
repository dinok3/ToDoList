# TO DO LIST

## Description
Classic to do list application where you can log in and create a new todo list and add, remove, mark as completed, update... tasks.
You can see to do lists of others but can't update/delete them.

## Note
Design of the application isn't great because the point of this application was to apply all the stuff that i learned into an application
that's working.Using more advanced stuff like class based views instead of function based, using Pillow to process images,
django-filters for filtering to do lists, authentication and login, signals, forms...

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/dinok3/ToDoList.git
cd ToDoList
pip install -r requirements.txt

py manage.py runserver
```
